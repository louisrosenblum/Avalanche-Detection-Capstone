%% Sensor and Grid locations


<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
s0 = [0 0];
s1 = [100 0];
s2 = [0 100];
s3 = [100 100];
>>>>>>> parent of 78d3b0e... Added temperature and dist to sensor calculation

%% Generate random temps/humidity/air pressure



<<<<<<< HEAD
%% Calc speed of sound


%% Randomly pick origin


%% Calculate distance to sensor



%% Generate phase delays



%% 4 copies of .wav file with delays
=======
%% Distance usage example

dist1 = distance(s0,grid{90,30})
>>>>>>> parent of 78d3b0e... Added temperature and dist to sensor calculation



%% Add noise 




%% The meat and potatoes of this bad boi
%  Calculate origin of signal



%% Plot sensors, grid, predicted origin, actual origin




%% Print if matching. If not how far off is it.
